        In recent years, with the rapid development of the logistics industry, 
    a huge amount of express delivery asks for high logistics distribution efficiency.
    And universities are in a special area of express delivery services. 
        On campus, for the sake of security, it is very inconvenient to 
    dispatch express mails and pick up the deliveries. 
        The ‘last mile’ of campus logistics express has become a bottleneck 
    restricting the development of logistics express delivery in colleges and universities. 
        Many college students have implemented O2O service entrepreneurship 
    for school express delivery and obtained some achievements, 
    but still lack effective management and efficient platforms. 
        The Campus Express Collection System is a mutual aid platform designed to solve these problems. 
        The specific research contents in this paper include the following three aspects: 
        (1) Starting with the study of current situation of the “last mile” problem at home and abroad, 
        this paper investigates and analyzes the development and existing problems of campus express delivery, 
        and puts forward ideas for improvement from the technical and management level; 
        (2) Using one certain university in China as an example, this paper analyzes and 
        designs the Campus Express Collection System by object-oriented methods and UML modeling tools. 
        The design mainly includes demand analysis, functional structure design, database design, etc.; 
        (3) Based on Wechat Mini Program and cloud database, basic functions of this system has been realized. 
        Users can log into the system to place orders, receive orders, apply for arbitration, etc. 
        The Campus Express Collection System helps solve the “last mile” problem of campus logistics distribution 
        in the form of friendly cooperation, providing convenience for picking up deliveries and 
        improving the efficiency of express delivery processing.
